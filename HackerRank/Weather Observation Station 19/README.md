## Easy, SQL (Basic)
Consider $P_1(a, c)$ and $P_2(b, d)$ to be two points on a 2D plane where $(a, b)$ are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and $(c, d)$ are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in **STATION**.

Query the [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between points $P_1$ and $P_2$ and format your answer to display `4` decimal digits.
