# [Print Prime Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/print-prime-numbers/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## Medium, SQL (Advanced)
Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to `1000`. Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (`&`) character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime `numbers ≤ 10` would be:

```
2&3&5&7
```
